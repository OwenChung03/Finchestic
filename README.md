# Finchestic
Finchestic FinTech Competition Receivable Finance Idea By Met-Us-First
Persuado code for Finchestic competition, Met-Us-First Receivable Finance Platform powered by NFT
### Main language used for backend development: 
1. Python 3.9 (AI, Image Recognition) 
2. Solidity 0.8.0 (Smart Contract Execution)
### Main language used for frontend development: 
1. JavaScript (React.JS), 
2. HTML 
3. CSS
4. Swift (For app development and app scannning, modified from Apple Developer)
## Methodlogy to integrate Python into Solidity: 
Use eth-brownie->chainlink python library to deploy python in Solidity
## Python library involved:
1. Scipy
2. Scikit-image
3. OpenCV
4. Tensorflow
5. Pandas
...
### Main Requirements: 
All Lenders and Borrowers need to deposit Met-Us-First coins as collateral, in which the coins are published by Initial Coin Offerings
## Our Service Process Flow:
1. Attract borrowers from the market (SMEs users can scan their recipt in our decentralised application, or we could make an IOS with Swift)
2. Our system would analyze the details with NLP (using Scikit-image, OpenCV and Scipy in python)
3. Call API from TransUnion/ or other credit rating database and conduct statistical analysis by ANOVA and Hypothesis testing with Pingouin Libary
4. Securitise the loans into a fund with statistical libaraies, based on risk rating measures, using statistical tools
5. Tokenize the funds proportionally, each lender could hold a unique NFT, with the artwork randomly generated with a varaible value NFT, and has a specific face value, similiar to a bond
6. Use Predictive Machine Learning Models to predict the expected ROI, Sharpe ratio, VaR and Expected Default Rate for the Funds -> Allow Investors to choose their suitable funds (Tensorflow)


## Model Refinement
1. Collect Relevant Data, such as Average Age of Debt or Days Sales Outstanding, Collection Effectiveness Index, Default Rate to create a local credit rating database
2. Enhance Fund Formation efficiency by enlarging the loan basis
